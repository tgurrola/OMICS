# Learning Objectives Week 4

1. Understand the Burroughs-Wheeler Alignment (BWA) algorithm and its applications.
   
    a. Derived from the BW transform, it is used to sift through the massive amounts of data from NGS. The BW transform is a data compression algorithm that plays a crucial role in the BWA underlying algorithms
   
     b. BWA uses two different algorithms for aligning NGS reads to a reference genome: the BWA-backtrack algorithm for short reads (up to 80 bps) and the BWA SW algorithm for longer reads (up to 100 kilobp)

   c. the primary function of BWA is to align sequences generated by NGS platforms to a reference genome
3. Differentiate between BWA and other alignment algorithms (like BLAST).
     a. BWA has several advantages compared to other alignment tools. 1st, BWA is designed to handle the large data sets generated by NGS platforms, and is able to align millions of reads in a relatively short amount of time

      b. 2nd, BWA is highly accurate and produces a high number of unique and valid alignments, reducing the amount of false positive alignments

      c. 3rd, BWA is flexible and can handle various types of sequencing data, including short reads from illumina platforms, long reads from oxford nanopore platforms, and even paired end reads

      d. In summary, BWA and BLAST are tools designed for different types of sequence analysis tasks. BWA is specialized for mapping short reads to a reference genome, commonly used in genomics and NGS data analysis. BLAST, on the other hand, is a more general-purpose tool for comparing sequences across various biological databases, used in tasks like sequence similarity searching and functional annotation.
   
5. Understand why we should **not** put large result-files into git repos.

   
7. Understand the purpose of generating alignment indexes.

   
9. Use samtools to view and count the number of aligned reads.

    
11. Use samtools flagstat to summarize an alignment result.

    
13. Understand the important fields of a SAM format.
